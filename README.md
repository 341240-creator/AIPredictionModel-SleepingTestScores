# AIPredictionModel-SleepingTestScores
Can a computer predict a test using study time and sleep? In this project I have train an AI to determine someone's test scores by sleep!

# Project Title

## Problem
What problem were you trying to solve? Why does it matter?
I am trying to solve how sleeping would determine whether someone would get good grades in a class by sleeping.

## Solution
How does your project work? (High-level, no heavy jargon)
My project works by, adding your sleep and the AI determining whether you can get a good test grade or not. But its still a work in progress!

## Tools
Languages, libraries, datasets, or AI models used.
The AI models used for this project would be, Thonny and also files in order to move the information around. 

## Results - Output Screenshot
What worked? (accuracy, output, example, or result)
The AI did somewhat succeed but its still a work in progress, sleeping wouldn't always tell you what your always gonna get on Tests. 

## Learning
One important thing you learned from this project.
One important thing that I learned from this prject would be that, working on coding is a bit hard ans also that, moving files from one place to another is also a bit hard.
